# My Test Cases:

## testing1

Tests the following:
- Checks if new statement will allow negative numbers and set capacity of 1
- Pushes two elements and checks if capacity has increased as expected, checks if empty, then pushes again to see if capacity has again increased
- Clears and checks if capacity was updated, then checks max!,min!, and top! to return underflow errors
- Pushes three elements and checks their corresponding min/max, then clears and deletes.
- Creates a new set of arrays of size, pushes 5 elements, and checks if capacity updated as well as max/min/top.
- pops and element and sees if top is updated
- clears and deletes

## testing2

Tests the following:
- Declares an illegal size of arrays and adds elements of 0, checks if capacity works appropriately.
- checks top/min/max, pops and checks again
- Declares an unspecified size array, adds a few elements (one is negative) and checks the min and size
- pops all entries and checks if empty, then deletes.
